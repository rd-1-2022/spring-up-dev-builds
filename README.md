# Spring Up Dev Releases
Repository storing snapshot releases

## Usage
You can download binaris for _linux_ and _macos_ from a release.

GitHub doesn't store executable bit so you need to `chmod +x` and
change binary name back to `spring-up`.

Releases are named from a date and time at a time release was build.

## Release
Just run a _Release Snapshot_ workflow manuall from a `main` branch and
binaries are built and _GitHub_ release created for those.
